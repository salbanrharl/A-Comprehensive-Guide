# 10 Best Anti-Detect Browser Software in 2025: Everything You Need to Know

## VPN vs. Anti-Detect Browsers: Whatâ€™s the Difference?

While **VPNs** are widely used to mask IP addresses and secure online activity, they donâ€™t fully prevent tracking. VPNs only anonymize your IP, leaving other identifiers like browser fingerprints and cookies exposed. **Anti-detect browsers** go a step further by spoofing browser fingerprints, creating unique virtual profiles, and isolating data, making tracking nearly impossible.

### Key Features of Anti-Detect Browsers:
- Mask IP addresses.
- Spoof browser fingerprints (e.g., resolution, user-agent, timezone).
- Isolate cookies, local storage, and cache.
- Simultaneously manage multiple profiles.

> Anti-detect browsers are especially useful for tasks like affiliate marketing, e-commerce, and web scraping.
