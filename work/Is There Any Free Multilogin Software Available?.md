## Budget-Friendly Alternatives to Scale Up

For those on a tight budget, **Firefox Portable** and **multiple Chrome profiles** offer basic multilogin functionality. However, these solutions lack advanced features like:
- Browser fingerprint management.
- Proxy integration for enhanced anonymity.
- Automation support for repetitive tasks.

These limitations make them less effective for businesses requiring high-level account management.
