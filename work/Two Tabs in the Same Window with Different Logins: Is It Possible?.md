# Two Tabs in the Same Window with Different Logins: Is It Possible?

Managing multiple logins for the same website in a single browser window has long been a challenge. Whether you are a developer or simply someone trying to separate work and personal accounts, this limitation can be frustrating. This article explores whether itâ€™s feasible to have tabs in the same Chrome window maintain distinct login sessions.

## Key Problem: Cookies Shared Across Tabs

One of the core challenges arises because browsers, including Chrome, save **cookies** per browser instance, not per tab. This means all tabs within the same browser session share the same login information, making it impossible to log into two accounts on the same website simultaneously in separate tabs.

For example:
- **Tab #1**: Logged into Gmail with Account A.
- **Tab #2**: Opening Gmail will automatically load Account A, rather than prompting for Account B.

### Common Workarounds:
1. **Using Incognito Mode**: Log into one account in the normal browser and the other in an incognito window.
2. **Creating Separate Profiles**: Chrome profiles allow each profile to have its own set of cookies and logins, but this requires separate browser windows.
3. **Using Virtual Browsers**: Tools like Multilogin enable multiple isolated browser sessions within the same environment.

## Proposed Solution: Cookies API and Tabs API

One creative idea suggested by developers is to use **Chromium Extensions** to manage cookies on a per-tab basis. This would involve:

1. **Backing up cookies for each tab**:
   - When switching to a different tab, save the cookies associated with that tab.
   
2. **Restoring cookies**:
   - Before displaying a tab, restore its respective cookies.

### Feasibility
While technically possible, this approach has major limitations:
- **Background Requests**: Cookies are used in background requests, not just in the visible tab. Switching cookies could cause these requests to fail.
- **Deprecated APIs**: Chromium has deprecated some blocking web request APIs needed to achieve this functionality.

## Alternatives: Firefox Multi-Account Containers

Firefox offers a feature called **Multi-Account Containers**, which allows users to open tabs in the same browser window with completely isolated cookies. This feature works seamlessly without requiring separate browser profiles or extensions. However, similar functionality is not natively available in Chrome.

### Cent Browser
Cent Browser, a Chromium-based browser, claims to support multi-login with separate cookies for different tabs. This raises the question of whether such features could be ported to Chrome via forking the Chromium project.

## Why Use Anti-Detect Browsers?

For advanced use cases, **anti-detect browsers** offer the best solution for managing multiple logins. These tools are designed to create completely isolated browsing environments, even within a single application.

### Multilogin: The Industry Leader
With Multilogin, you can create unique browser profiles that mimic separate devices, making it possible to manage multiple accounts simultaneously. Key benefits include:
- Unique browser fingerprints for each session.
- Advanced team collaboration tools.
- Automation support via Puppeteer and Selenium.

## Final Thoughts

While itâ€™s currently not possible to manage multiple logins in the same Chrome window natively, workarounds like incognito mode, separate profiles, or anti-detect browsers like **Multilogin** provide viable solutions. If Chrome developers were to introduce isolation APIs similar to Firefoxâ€™s Multi-Account Containers, it could greatly improve flexibility for users managing multiple accounts.

For now, developers and users requiring advanced multi-login capabilities should explore tools like Multilogin to streamline their workflows.
